# Data Capture and NLP Analysis Project
Conducted an in-depth analysis of unstructured textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to uncover key insights and trends around Tesla and its competitors.
Developed Python scripts to perform web scraping using BeautifulSoup, collecting news articles and data on Tesla, leveraging APIs such as News API for continuous data capture.
Implemented sentiment analysis using TextBlob to assess public opinion and classify sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative, effectively quantifying media perception around Tesla.
Performed topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and visualized results using histograms and bar charts to highlight key narratives and public discussions.
Engineered a Word2Vec model to extract word vector representations and identify semantically similar words within news articles.
Utilized machine learning and NLP libraries like SpaCy, Gensim, and TensorFlow for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, word embeddings, and feature extraction.
